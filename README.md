## Note!

Terminal Land in an early beta stage of development. We’re hacking away at it daily! All of the usual beta things apply: things will break, or be weird, or both. Hang in there with us, report bugs, and have fun!

## About

This is a different kind of game, one in which interactions are purely text-based and the graphics exist solely in your mind. It might not be your cup of tea, but that’s OK—it’s not for everyone. ☺️

Terminal Land is [interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction) set in a persistent online multiplayer universe. Spanning multiple genres (spaceships and spells!) and including crafting elements, there’s something for everyone.

## Play

You can download a [desktop client](https://github.com/neatnik/terminal.land/releases/latest), or play in your browser at https://terminal.land.
