## Note!

_Terminal Land is taking a break but will be back in 2023._

## About

This is a different kind of game, one in which interactions are purely text-based and the graphics exist solely in your mind. It might not be your cup of tea, but that’s OK—it’s not for everyone. ☺️

Terminal Land is [interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction) set in a persistent online multiplayer universe. Spanning multiple genres (spaceships and spells!) and including crafting elements, there’s something for everyone.
